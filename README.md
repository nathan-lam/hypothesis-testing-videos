# hypothesis-testing-videos


# Goal
To create a series of videos to explain the assumptions and situations would best fit a specific hypothesis test.  

My hope is to explain why certain hypothesis tests need to work in certain conditions as opposed to a list of instructions to blindly follow  

This will be animated using manim, a python animation library

# What I have so far
Created classes for specific distributions and methods to find the confidence interval and p-values

# To Do
* Write the script for 1 sample z-test
  *  Create animations
